# Testing

The purpose of this folder is to test the model saved as a .h5 file. We test the model by printing an output for each row of data, indicating whether the data represents WiFi or Bluetooth, and then in the same line, we print what the model predicted it to be. This not only helps in testing the saved model but also provides a visual representation of what the model's predicting for each row.

> [!NOTE]
