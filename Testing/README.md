# Testing

So the purpose of this folder was to test the model that we saved into a .h5 file. We test the model by simply printing an output for each row of data that tells us whether it's actually wifi or Bluetooth and then in that same line we also print out what the model predicted it to be. This helps test the saved model but also gives us a visual representation of what the model is predicting for each row.

> **Before running:**
> Make sure you have a .csv file with your data in the folder, in this case one is already provided. Also, make sure to update the code so that you have the correct path for your data.
> For tensorflow make sure to that you have python 3.8 - 3.11 in order to properly run the code.
