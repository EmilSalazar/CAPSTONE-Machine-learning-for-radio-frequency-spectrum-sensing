# Waterfall plot

Since we had issues with GNU radio we weren't able to get a live spectrogram coming through our GUI. One idea that our advisor suggested was to create our own spectrogram with the data already provided and output that into the GUI. The main.py file was our attempt at doing that but it wasn't fully succesful since it only outputs the plot as an image and not a live video. Still we provided the code above in case you might find it useful.
