# Training

In this directory we have the code for our machine learning model. We based it off of another example that we found online but we made a few adjustments to the code. One big difference is how were not only training it but were also getting the saved model as an output and saving it into the testing directory.

For tensorflow make sure to that you have python 3.8 - 3.11 in order to properly run the code. You might need to update your environment variables after installing another version of python. 

To run in terminal:
```
 python .\train.py
```
